## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes **loan default risk patterns** using **SQL and Power BI** to uncover financial and demographic factors contributing to loan non-repayment.  
It explores borrower characteristics such as **income level, employment type, education, credit score**, and **loan purpose**, revealing trends that can help lenders **predict and mitigate credit risk**.

Data was extracted and transformed using **SQL queries** for filtering, aggregation, and segmentation, then visualized through **Power BI dashboards**.  
The interactive report provides stakeholders with a holistic view of **loan performance, borrower profiles, and default behavior** over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **loan defaults by year, age group, and credit score**.  
- Identify **income and employment segments** with higher default probabilities.  
- Compare **loan amounts and default rates** across demographic variables.  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** that enables dynamic filtering and exploration.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** | Data extraction, filtering, and aggregations |
| **Power BI** | Visualization, dashboard creation, and KPI development |
| **Power Query** | ETL and data cleaning before modeling |
| **DAX** | Custom calculations for default rate, YOY change, and KPIs |
| **Excel** | Data validation and formatting before import |

## 🧩 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and structured raw loan data in SQL.  
- Created joins and aggregations to combine borrower demographics and loan info.  
- Used **Power Query** for additional data transformation and cleaning.  
- Developed calculated DAX measures for:
  - `Default Rate (%)`
  - `YOY Loan Amount Change`
  - `Average Loan Amount by Age Group`
  - `Loan Default Ratio by Employment Type`

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Unemployed and part-time applicants** showed the highest loan default rates.  
- **High-income borrowers** had the lowest probability of default across all loan types.  
- **Default rates stabilized after 2016**, reflecting improved underwriting policies.  
- **Education loans** showed slightly higher risk than home or auto loans.  
- The **YOY loan amount growth rate** remained steady, with occasional dips around 2015–2016.  

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- Improved understanding of **financial risk analytics** using SQL and Power BI.  
- Enhanced skills in **data modeling, KPI development, and data storytelling**.  
- Learned to create **dynamic measures (DAX)** to calculate key metrics like YOY growth and default rates.  
- Strengthened **ETL experience using Power Query** for structured data workflows.  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **SQL and Power BI** can be combined to analyze financial data, identify high-risk borrower segments, and monitor loan performance through interactive dashboards.  
It highlights how data analytics can guide **risk mitigation strategies** and support **data-driven decision-making** in the financial sector.
